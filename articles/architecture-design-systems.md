 **Wright Blocks** | 1933

 John Lloyd Wright (December 12, 1892 – December 20, 1972) was an American architect and toy inventor. Born in Oak Park, Illinois, Wright was the second-oldest son of famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright – [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lloyd_Wright). In late 1949 he patented—and in 1950 began to sell—a new version of his Wright Blocks, an interlocking block set which he had first patented in 1933. These were rectilinear, cross-grooved wooden blocks packaged in "No. 1" and "No. 2" sets of 36 and 70 pieces respectively, which differed slightly in the types of pieces they included and in the materials used. - [Incrediblearet.org](http://www.incredibleart.org/links/jlwright/lloyd_wright3.html)
