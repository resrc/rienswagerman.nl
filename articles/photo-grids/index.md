# The dynamic nature of visual grids

## How grids are used to express meaning

In 1967 Agnes Martin stopped painting. She bought an Airstream trailer and went back to the protection of the New Mexico desert. On a clear day, five years later, Agnes Martin traveled to Germany at the invitation of a German Art Printer to create a set of silk screens. They constitute the grammar of linear divisions (grids) that she would employ for the rest of her life [1].

To me, Agnes Martin, (one of my favorite artists) shows us one of the purest manifestations of the grid. Martin mathematically worked out on paper the line intervals in any given series of pictures before she began painting; sheets filled with complex calculations. While this is sounding technical, it was to create the purest, abstract paintings that express innocence of mind.

She writes 'our response to line and tone and color is the same as our response to sounds'. A familiar analogy; one of the simplest of all systems of proportions in book design is based on the intervals of the diatonic musical scale. Pages that embody these basic musical proportions have been common in Europe for more than thousand years [2]. The Golden Ratio and Fibonacci are the most well-known proportions, which stem from the structure of the human body and are still applied in painting, book design, architecture.

## A grid breaks space or time into regular units

The visual manifestation of the grid came to the fore during the Industrial Revolution. Industrial standardization went parallel with the application of rational concepts. Functionalism broke up the objects and spaces we use into functional units, in order to create more efficient structures in the name of rationalization.

The grid probably reached its loudest presence, however, in the pop art of the 1960s. Artists like Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, raised the language of mechanical reproduction to the level of high art, and the grid appeared front and center.


## Grids express meaning

Grids are not only just functional ways of displaying information. They inevitably convey meaning. When a grid is filled with photos, any image is in a relationship with the other, forming new meanings.

An impressive example of grid design is Ed van der Elsken's photobook *Jazz*. Pages are split into two-, three-, four-, and six-part image combinations, resembling the clusters of notes in a saxophone or trumpet run. Graphically, vertical clusters of images suggest piano keys, while horizontal, stretched images recall held notes. The result is a book that visually echoes the music itself [3].

## Digital grids are fluid

New digital fluidity, by adjusting the size and negative space. Morphing.
