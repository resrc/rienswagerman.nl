# Design and technology are fascinating. How they lead to new ways to make things and new things to make.

### About me

Founder and Director at [viewbook.com](https://viewbook.com). My interests are in design, [photography](https://rienswagerman.viewbook.com) and technology.

I began my entrepreneurial career building websites, because of my curiosity about the internet as something full of unknowable potential. This led to the founding of two successful design and web-development studios. My quest to empower people to manifest their ideas through new web technologies, together with my interest in [photography](http://rienswagerman.viewbook.com), led to the start of [Viewbook](viewbook.com) in 2009, where I am director, designer and developer. Viewbook is successfully helping thousands of photographers world wide building their own photography websites.

In 2015 I participated in the Dutch Design Week with [kuub.us](http://kuub.us), a wireless switch that explores interaction with technology in a playful and natural way. It is the first project in which my experience with technology and (interaction) design are combined into a physical product.

I live in Rotterdam (The Netherlands) on the beautiful peninsula Katendrecht , a transformed harbour area, with his family of six (including twins).
